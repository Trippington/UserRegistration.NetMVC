# UserRegistration.NetMVC
Expansion of the UserLogin project which allows users to either login or register

This project is built ontop of the UserLogin project.

This code allows users to create a new account (username and password) which then gets stored in the database.
If the Username already exists, the "RegistrationFailure" page is displayed with a message telling the user that the username is not available.

Note: the views for "RegistrationSuccess/Failure" are not included.
